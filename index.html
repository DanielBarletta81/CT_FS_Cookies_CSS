<!--2. Assignment: Creating a Recipe Submission Button and Styled Form
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to create a button that links to a separate page for 
users to add a recipe.
 Additionally, 
students will style a form utilizing techniques covered in the lesson on Forms and Form Elements.

Task 1: Create an HTML file containing a button that links to a separate page 
for recipe submission. Include elements such as <button> with appropriate attributes 
    and an anchor tag <a> to link to the submission page.
        
  Task 2: Use CSS to style the button with hover effects using pseudo-classes (:hover).
   Ensure that the button stands out and invites users to click.

Expected Outcome: Apply CSS pseudo-class styling to add visual appeal 
and provide additional queues to users.
